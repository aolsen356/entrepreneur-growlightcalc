## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Buying Based on "Wattage Equivalent"
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Trust "1000W equivalent" claims
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Check actual power draw and PPFD ratings
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Look for independent test results

### Mistake #2: Hanging Light Too High or Too Low
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Set it and forget it
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Adjust height as plants grow
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Monitor for light stress (bleaching, burning)
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Watch for stretching (light too far away)

### Mistake #3: Wrong Light Spectrum for Growth Stage
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Use only blue light for flowering
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Use only red light for seedlings
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Use full spectrum for all stages (safest)
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Use blue-heavy for veg, red-heavy for flower (advanced)

### Mistake #4: Inadequate Coverage Area
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Assume edge-to-edge coverage
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Use manufacturer's flower coverage specs (smaller area)
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Overlap lights for even coverage in large areas
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Rotate plants if coverage is uneven

### Mistake #5: No Temperature Monitoring
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Ignore heat buildup from lights
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Monitor temperature at canopy level
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Add ventilation if temps exceed 85°F (29°C)
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Dim lights or raise them if plants show heat stress

### Mistake #6: Inconsistent Light Schedule
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Manually turn lights on/off
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Change schedule frequently
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Use a reliable timer
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Maintain consistent daily schedule
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Avoid light interruptions during dark period (photoperiod plants)

### Mistake #7: Neglecting Light Quality Over Time
- [ ] ❌ **Don't**: Expect lights to last forever at full output
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Replace fluorescent bulbs every 12-18 months
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Expect LED degradation after 50,000+ hours
- [ ] ✅ **Do**: Clean light fixtures monthly (dust reduces output)

## Weekly Maintenance Checklist

### Every Week
- [ ] Check plants for signs of light stress (bleaching, burning, tacoing)
- [ ] Check for stretching (increase light intensity or lower fixture)
- [ ] Wipe down light fixture to remove dust
- [ ] Verify timer is functioning correctly
- [ ] Rotate plants if coverage is uneven

### Every Month
- [ ] Deep clean light fixture and reflectors
- [ ] Check all electrical connections
- [ ] Verify light height is optimal for current growth stage
- [ ] Measure PPFD at canopy level (if you have a meter)
- [ ] Inspect power cords for damage

### Every 3 Months
- [ ] Recalculate DLI needs as plants mature
- [ ] Consider spectrum adjustment for growth stage
- [ ] Check for light degradation (reduced output)
- [ ] Evaluate if additional/fewer lights are needed

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Plants Stretching (Tall & Leggy)
**Cause**: Light too weak or too far away
- [ ] Lower light closer to plants
- [ ] Increase light intensity (add more lights or dim less)
- [ ] Increase daily light hours

### Leaves Bleaching (Turning White/Yellow)
**Cause**: Light too intense or too close
- [ ] Raise light higher above plants
- [ ] Reduce light intensity (dim if possible)
- [ ] Reduce daily light hours slightly

### Leaf Edges Curling Up ("Tacoing")
**Cause**: Heat or light stress
- [ ] Raise light higher
- [ ] Improve air circulation
- [ ] Reduce temperature in grow area
- [ ] Dim lights if possible

### Slow Growth Despite Adequate Light
**Possible Causes**:
- [ ] Check nutrient levels (light alone isn't enough)
- [ ] Verify temperature is in optimal range
- [ ] Ensure adequate CO2 (open room to fresh air)
- [ ] Check for pests or disease

### Uneven Growth Across Plants
**Cause**: Uneven light distribution
- [ ] Rotate plants weekly
- [ ] Add supplemental lights to dim areas
- [ ] Reposition main light for better coverage
- [ ] Use reflective material on walls

## Quick Reference: PPFD Targets

| Plant Type | PPFD Range | DLI Range | Light Hours |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Seedlings | 100-300 | 5-12 | 16-18 |
| Herbs/Lettuce | 200-400 | 12-17 | 14-16 |
| Tomatoes/Peppers | 400-600 | 20-30 | 14-18 |
| Cannabis (Veg) | 400-600 | 25-40 | 18 |
| Cannabis (Flower) | 600-1000 | 35-50 | 12 |
| Succulents | 200-400 | 10-15 | 12-14 |

**Formula**: DLI = (PPFD × light hours × 3600) ÷ 1,000,000

## Pro Tips for Maximum Results

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower intensity and increase gradually
2. **Measure, Don't Guess**: Use a PAR meter or app for accurate PPFD readings
3. **Consistency is Key**: Maintain the same light schedule daily
4. **Watch Your Plants**: They'll tell you if light is too much or too little
5. **Don't Skimp on Quality**: Good lights last 5-10 years and save electricity
6. **Use a Timer with Battery Backup**: Power outages won't disrupt your schedule
7. **Keep Records**: Track light height, intensity, and hours for future reference
8. **Clean Regularly**: Dust can reduce light output by 10-20%
9. **Plan for Growth**: Position lights so you can raise them as plants mature
10. **Consider Automation**: Smart plugs let you adjust schedules remotely
