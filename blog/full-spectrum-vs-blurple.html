        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-12">
            <p>If you've been growing indoors for a few years, you probably remember when purple-pink "blurple" LED grow lights dominated the market. Amazon was flooded with them. They promised to "give plants exactly what they need" by only providing red and blue wavelengths.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to 2026, and the grow light landscape has completely changed. Visit any serious grow forum, and you'll see full spectrum white LEDs everywhere. The purple lights? They're mostly collecting dust in basements or being sold cheap on marketplace apps.</p>

            <p>So what happened? And more importantly, if you're still using blurple lights or considering buying one because they're cheap, should you?</p>

            <p>Let's break down the science, compare real-world performance, and help you make the right decision for your grow space.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is a Blurple Grow Light?</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">"Blurple" is a portmanteau of "blue" and "purple" - describing the characteristic color these lights emit. They combine:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Blue LEDs (440-460nm)</strong> - For vegetative growth and compact structure</li>
                <li><strong>Red LEDs (630-660nm)</strong> - For flowering and fruit development</li>
                <li>Sometimes <strong>IR (infrared)</strong> and <strong>UV</strong> diodes in small amounts</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The theory behind blurple lights made sense at the time: plants primarily absorb red and blue light for photosynthesis. Green light, the reasoning went, is mostly reflected (that's why plants look green). So why waste energy producing wavelengths plants don't use?</p>

            <div class="bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
                <p class="text-purple-800"><strong>Popular blurple brands from 2015-2018:</strong> VIPARSPECTRA (older models), Roleadro, King Plus, Galaxyhydro, BESTVA (older models)</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Problem with Blurple Logic</h3>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The "only red and blue" theory turned out to be overly simplified. Research from Utah State University, Michigan State, and NASA has since shown:</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Plants DO use green light</strong> - Green wavelengths penetrate deeper into the canopy and reach lower leaves</li>
                <li><strong>Full spectrum improves morphology</strong> - Plants grown under red/blue only can develop abnormally</li>
                <li><strong>The efficiency argument was wrong</strong> - Modern white LED diodes are MORE efficient than old red/blue diodes</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is a Full Spectrum Grow Light?</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Full spectrum LED grow lights emit white light that includes all wavelengths across the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectrum (400-700nm). They look similar to natural sunlight - either a warm white, neutral white, or cool white depending on the exact diode mix.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Most modern full spectrum LEDs use <strong>Samsung LM301B</strong> or <strong>LM301H</strong> diodes, which are among the most efficient LEDs ever made for grow light applications (up to 3.1 umol/J efficiency).</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Science: Why Full Spectrum Wins</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. The McCree Curve: Not Just Red and Blue</h3>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">In the 1970s, researcher Keith McCree measured how efficiently plants convert different wavelengths of light into photosynthesis. His findings created the famous "McCree Curve" - and it shows plants use ALL visible wavelengths, not just red and blue.</p>

            <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
                <p class="text-blue-800"><strong>Key finding:</strong> Green light (500-600nm) is about 80-90% as efficient as red light for photosynthesis - NOT zero as blurple manufacturers claimed.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Canopy Penetration</h3>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">One advantage green light has over red and blue: it penetrates deeper into the plant canopy. While red and blue light are absorbed by the top leaves, green light passes through and reaches lower leaves that would otherwise be shaded.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">This means full spectrum lights provide more uniform lighting throughout the entire plant, improving overall yield - especially for dense, bushy plants.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. LED Efficiency Revolution</h3>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">When blurple lights were popular, the efficiency argument had some merit. Old red and blue LEDs were more efficient than old white LEDs.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">But LED technology advanced rapidly:</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">While we recommend full spectrum for most growers, there are a few scenarios where using existing blurple lights still makes sense:</p>

            <div class="space-y-4">
                <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. You already own them and just need to grow something quickly</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Blurple lights work. Plants will grow. If you have them sitting around and need to grow some seedlings or herbs, use what you have rather than buying new.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Supplemental flowering light</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Some growers add blurple lights during flowering for extra red wavelengths alongside their main full spectrum lights. This is advanced optimization and not necessary for most grows.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Very small grows with no expansion plans</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you're growing a single houseplant or a few herbs and have zero budget, a $30 blurple from Amazon will work. Just know you're accepting significant efficiency losses.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 p-4 rounded-lg mt-6">
                <p class="text-yellow-800"><strong>Important:</strong> Never buy a NEW blurple light in 2026. Budget full spectrum options like the Spider Farmer SF-300 ($40) or Mars Hydro TS-600 ($60) are now so affordable there's no reason to buy outdated technology.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Should You Upgrade from Blurple to Full Spectrum?</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Ask yourself these questions:</p>

            <div class="space-y-4 mb-6">
                <div class="flex items-start space-x-3">

                    <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Is your blurple light more than 2-3 years old?</strong> Yes? LED diodes degrade over time, and your light is likely already 20-30% dimmer than when new.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex items-start space-x-3">
                    <span class="text-primary text-xl">&#10003;</span>
                    <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Are you paying high electricity bills?</strong> Yes? Full spectrum LEDs can cut your grow room electricity cost by 30-50%.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex items-start space-x-3">
                    <span class="text-primary text-xl">&#10003;</span>
                    <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Are you struggling to diagnose plant problems?</strong> Yes? Inspecting plants under purple light makes it nearly impossible to spot nutrient deficiencies, pests, or diseases early.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex items-start space-x-3">

                    <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Do you want better yields?</strong> Yes? Full spectrum lights typically improve yields 20-40% compared to blurple lights with the same wattage draw.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A 200W blurple light running 18 hours/day for 6 months costs about $78 in electricity (at $0.12/kWh). A 150W full spectrum light producing the SAME amount of usable light costs about $52.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Savings: $26 per 6 months, or $52/year.</strong> A $150 full spectrum light pays for itself in under 3 years through electricity savings alone - not counting improved yields.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Are blurple grow lights bad?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Blurple lights aren't necessarily bad, but they're outdated technology from 2015-2018. They work for growing plants but are 30-50% less efficient than modern full spectrum LEDs. The purple light also makes it difficult to inspect plants for health issues, pests, or deficiencies.</p>

                <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Why do some LED grow lights look purple?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Purple (blurple) grow lights combine primarily red and blue LEDs, the two wavelengths plants use most for photosynthesis. The technology was popular in early LED grow lights because it theoretically only provided "useful" light. Modern research shows plants benefit from the full spectrum, and newer diodes are more efficient.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is a full spectrum LED grow light?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Full spectrum LED grow lights emit white light similar to natural sunlight, typically using Samsung LM301 diodes or similar. They include all wavelengths from blue through red (400-700nm), plus some infrared and UV. The white appearance comes from combining many wavelengths, not just red and blue.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I upgrade from blurple to full spectrum?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, upgrading is recommended if your blurple light is over 2-3 years old. Modern full spectrum LEDs use 30-50% less electricity for the same growth, run cooler, last longer, and make plant inspection easier. The upgrade typically pays for itself in 1-2 years through energy savings.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I mix blurple and full spectrum lights?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, you can mix light types during a transition period. Some growers add blurple lights during flowering for extra red wavelengths. However, for most growers, running all full spectrum lights is simpler and more efficient.</p>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Final Verdict: Full Spectrum is the Clear Winner</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The debate between full spectrum and blurple LED grow lights is essentially settled. Full spectrum wins on:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> 30-50% more light output per watt</li>
                <li><strong>Yields:</strong> Better growth and higher production</li>
                <li><strong>Plant health:</strong> Full spectrum encourages normal development</li>
                <li><strong>Usability:</strong> See your plants' true colors for diagnosis</li>
                <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Modern LEDs last 50,000-100,000 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Total cost:</strong> Lower electricity bills pay for the upgrade</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The only scenario where blurple makes sense is if you already own one and need to grow something immediately with zero budget for upgrades. For anyone buying new, full spectrum is the only sensible choice in 2026.</p>
